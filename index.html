     Copyright is a very big conflict in the world because people always want what the ther one has and they always cant have so they take it and most of is is just copy and paste on the computers because it is so easy to do and it is already there so you only have to push a little bit of buttons and you got it .Thats why copyright is such an big issue becuase it so easy and anyone can do it. ANd its bad becuase your stealing it from another person and you are going to get in major troubleif someone finds about it . Thats why you have to get licencesd to use the trademark
